look at what she is wearing, your beautiful eyes
taste how a michelin star shines, the perfect night
don’t worry wake up early exercise

listen to what we are saying, your beautiful ears
the things around you are breaking, but don’t be scared
We have the things that you need, and we’ll be there

so just take your time
we’ll be right outside
I will always wait for you

see the colors shine
let it fill your mind
something sparkling something new

feel the touch of the fabric, your beautiful skin
atomic purified air, please breathe deeply my friend
no hesitation the cleansing now begins

you feel the nutrients working, your beautiful blood
a custom treatment for you, calculated with love
we guarantee, your youth will be restored

so just take your time
we’ll be right outside
I will always wait for you

see the colors shine
let it fill your mind
something sparkling something new
